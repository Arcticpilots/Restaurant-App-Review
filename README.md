# Restaurants Reviews App
---

This **Restaurant Reviews** projects is a mobile-ready app adapted for all devices. It also implements the latest accessibility features following the **ARIA** model. It is also offline first, so don't worry about slow connection or none at all as you always get feed back.

### How To Use

* You can start by downloading the zip file [HERE](https://github.com/Arcticpilots/Restaurant-App-Review/) then while in the folder start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and that's it!

* _OR_ you can view the live version [HERE]().

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
