# Restaurants Reviews App
---

This **Restaurant Reviews** projects is a mobile-ready app adapted for all devices. It also implements the latest accessibility features following the **ARIA** model. It is also offline first, so don't worry about slow connection or none at all as you always get feed back.

### How To Use

* You can start by downloading the zip file [HERE](https://github.com/Arcticpilots/Restaurant-App-Review/) then while in the folder start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and that's it!

* _OR_ you can view the live version [HERE](https://arcticpilots.github.io/Restaurant-App-Review/).
